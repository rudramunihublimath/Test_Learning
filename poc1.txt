API Creation Utility – Summary

To streamline the Azure API creation and deployment process, we have developed an API Creation Utility that significantly reduces manual effort and minimizes errors.

Key Highlights

Manual effort reduced from 2–3 hours to less than 5 minutes.

Migration time and resource utilization have been reduced substantially.

Human errors during setup and configuration are nearly eliminated.

APIM Spec Generation: Automatically generates the Azure APIM specification file based on the provider spec.

Validation & Header Checks: Performs validation and adds necessary X-Header checks.

Version Control Automation: Handles Git commit, push, and merge request creation from feature branch to release branch.

CI/CD Integration: Sets access tokens and CI/CD pipeline variables automatically.

Build & Deployment: Triggers build pipelines and creates the package version for deployment.
